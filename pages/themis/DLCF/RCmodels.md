We decided in 2018 to test the Batisense solution, a prediction solution developed by the Probayes company, that schematizes the building as a set of electrical/thermal circuits in order to model its behavior.

Below is represented a R3C2 model, which requires a data commonly unavailable in practice: the wall temperature of the building

From an operational point of view, using a model from the cloud to manage distribution on the field is not that easy because it has to be recalibrated constantly.
