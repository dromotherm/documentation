## Themis without any SIM

It is possible to use Themis without SIM, but you may have difficulties related to time and date.

Indeed, for time management, linux systems typically synchronise with NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers.

Anyway, when booting a Themis machine without connecting it to a network linked to a NTP server, it is possible to manually set time on Themis

Usually the Themis server can be reached on 192.168.1.2
