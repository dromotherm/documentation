The Themis tools are developped on the basis of the emoncms ecosystem

They consist of :
- a vizualisation tool for creating psychometric diagrams 
- an algorithm dedicated to the calculation of infiltration losses on a building
- a specific interfacer for emonhub performing in tcpip mode the operation of an rs485 bus, allowing the deployment of long range 169Mhz sensors and the cooperation with boilers rooms controllers
- a specific interfacer for emonhub managing an ethernet socket on a HIOKI 8204-20 datalogger, in order to easily operate thermocouple sensors (and PT100)
