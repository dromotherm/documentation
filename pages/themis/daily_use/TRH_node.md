Themis uses different python services for most operations related to connectivity with sensors and real world. For modbusTCP and 169 Mhz radio, Themis has got its own intelligence, including devices autodiscovery and configuration. 

To monitor in realime electric consumption, Themis uses [emonhub](http://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub), which is maintained by a group of open source developers.
